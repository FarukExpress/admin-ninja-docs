# Getting Support

On this page, you will find how to get support and how to raise a perfect support ticket to resolve your issues quickly with minimum conversation. We value your time üïù

## Raising Support Ticket

Raising a support ticket in the support portal is as simple as commenting on a post. However, If you want to get your issues resolved quickly please follow below guide:

### New Issue - New ticket

It will be good if you create support ticket if you have any question/issue which is not related to your current ticket.

Let's say you opened a ticket for the installation issue and want to ask about some component usage then it will be better to close the installation ticket and open another ticket for that component to make the support portal more accurate and easy.

### Sharing Code or Snippet

If you want to show us some code it will be better if you can format it properly and use code block so your pasted code gets highlighted.

### Reproducing Issue/Bug - Starter-kit

If you have a ticket where we need to have a look at your code like some component's certain feature is working in our live demo but not in your downloaded package then it will be better you give us an actual issue or reproduction steps.

::: warning
Never upload our package or modified version of our package on public sites where others can view or download it.

### Framework Support

You can get support for framework related questions by raising the issue at their Github repo.

Good candidates for framework support are:

- How to use x component (x means any Vue Component)
- x component not working as expected

### Third Party Package Support

Same as framework support, if you have any query regarding how to use any provided package other than their UI you can ask it in their respective Github repo issue section.
