# Style

## Introduction

Tailwindcss is a utility-first CSS framework that enables you to rapidly build custom user interfaces. Unlike other CSS frameworks, Tailwindcss is highly customizable and provides a low-level approach, allowing you to create bespoke designs without being restricted by opinionated styles that are difficult to override.

## Installation

To get started with Tailwindcss, you need to install it along with its dependencies. Open your terminal and run the following command:

````bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest

## Configuration

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
````

## Configuration

After the installation, you need to initialize the Tailwindcss configuration file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will create a tailwind.config.js file in your project directory, which you can customize to suit your specific needs.

## Usage

To apply Tailwindcss styles to your components, you can utilize the utility classes provided by the framework. Here's an example of using Tailwindcss in a React component:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-200">
      <div className="bg-white shadow overflow-hidden sm:rounded-lg">
        <div className="px-4 py-5 sm:px-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg leading-6 font-medium text-gray-900">
            Profile
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-1 max-w">
            This information will be displayed publicly so be careful what you
            share.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

By applying the Tailwindcss classes to your HTML elements or React components, you can quickly style them according to your requirements.

## Tailwindcss Configuration

The tailwind.config.js file provides configuration options for Tailwindcss. Here's an example of the configuration file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "./public/index.html"],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'className'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

In this configuration file, you can define various options such as purging unused CSS, enabling dark mode, extending the default theme, customizing variants, and adding plugins.
