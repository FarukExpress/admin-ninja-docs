# Folder Structure React Js

To effectively work with the ElysianDash Admin Template, it's important to understand its folder structure and the contents it includes.

## Root Structure

The `root` folder serves as the core of the application. It follows the following structure:

- `src`: Contains the main source code of the application.
  - `assets`: Holds various assets like images and SCSS files.
    - `images`: Directory for image assets.
    - `scss`: Directory for SCSS files.
  - `components`: Houses all the components used in the template.
    - `partials`: Contains reusable partial components.
    - `ui`: Includes UI components.
    - `widgets`: Contains widget components.
  - `mocks`: Contains constant-related files.
    - `data.js`: File for data constants.
    - `appex-chart.js`: File for AppEx chart constants.
    - `chartjs-data.js`: File for Chart.js data constants.
  - `server`: contains fake api.
  - `config`: Holds configuration files.
  - `Layout`: Contains layout-related files.
  - `hooks`: Directory for custom hooks.
  - `store`: Contains Redux Toolkit store files.
  - `pages`: Holds the different pages or views of the application.
    - `dashboard`: Contains files related to the dashboard page.
    - `components`: Contains files related to the components page.
    - `chart`: Contains files related to the chart page.
  - `App.jsx`: Main application component.
  - `main.jsx`: Entry point file.

Additionally, you'll find other files at the root level:

- `favicon.svg`: Favicon image file.
- `index.html`: HTML file for the application.
- `.gitignore`: File specifying Git ignored files and directories.
- `package.json`: File containing project metadata and dependencies.
- `README.md`: Documentation file.
- `postcss.config.js`: Configuration file for PostCSS.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.

## Working with Assets

The `assets` folder is where you can store logos and other static assets that your application requires.

## Components

The `components` folder is where you should place your reusable components. Each component should have its own folder with the component's name. For example:

- `partials/Header/index.jsx`: Header component.
- `ui/Button`: Button component.
- `ui/Card`: Card component.
- `ui/Dropdown`: Dropdown component.

To use these components, import them into your `App.js` file or other relevant files.

## Layouts

The `Layout` folder contains the layout files for your application. You can add new layouts here or modify existing ones.

## Pages

The `pages` folder is where you'll find the different views or pages of your application. You can add new views here or modify existing ones.

## Store

The `store` folder contains Redux Toolkit store files for managing application state using Redux. You can use this folder to organize your Redux-related code.

## Constants

The `constants` folder is where you can define and store your constants. You can place your constant-related files here.
