Let's install your project first, please visit the [installation](installation.html) page for a detailed guide on how to install and run ElysianDash.

To get started you can check the [folder](development/folder-structure.html) structure of our template to understand how it works.

Next, certainly, you want to create new pages and want to get started with your project, For this, you can check our Layout docs to understand how to use them. Certainly, the default layout is a zero-config layout but still if you want to understand each [layout](development/layout.html) type, Go for it.

For styling, our ElysianDash have managed to provide separate space for your style where you can write your style and don't accidentally delete ours. Make sure to check out Template Styles for it.

### Starter kit vs Full package

### Starter Kit

Starter-kit is a minimal template from where you can start your project quickly instead of removing stuff that isn't needed. Below are quick notes on the starter-kit:

- No Auth
- No Dashboard
- No Apps
- No Pages
- No Elements

Use it if you don't want to clutter your project with extra libs which isn't required.

Don't worry about configuring third party libs which if you want to use them in starter-kit, our template is so flexible that all you have to do is just import lib file in your file and provide a third-party package that is ready to use üòç.

### Full package

This setup have all the things which you can see in live demo. The full package will have all the app, pages, and elements. You can copy the necessary things from there and then use them on your own project.

If you want to use the full package then you may need to remove things that you don't use or replace them with your content.

### Conclusion

According to us, starter-kit is easy to get started with minimal setup and our folder and code structure will help you adding libs support in starter-kit more easily than ever. Still if your project becomes easy with full package go for it

::: warning
We have not removed all required packages to make the above functionality work from package.json. Once you finish your project development, Do not forget to remove unused packages from the package.json file.
